# better-left-pad-
Adds padding to the left of text, meant for React script kiddies who are too stupid too write a basic 4 line function themselves and would rather bloat their project with 8000 NPM packages.

Since I guess 1.8M JavaScript "Programmers" depend on NPM packages for basic "Intro To Programming 101" level code, I thought I would rewrite it in less then 5 minutes to be mildly faster.

## Usage
```js
padleft("words", 5);
padleft("words", 5, "#");
```
